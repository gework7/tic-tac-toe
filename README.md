Tic Tac Toe Game with Minimax Algorithm (JavaScript)
This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using the minimax algorithm in JavaScript. The game is played in the browser and allows you to play against the computer, which uses the minimax algorithm to make its moves.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open index.html in your preferred web browser.
3. Click on the cells of the game board to make your moves.
4. Follow the prompts on the screen to play the game.
5. Enjoy the game!

## How it Works
The game uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move for the computer to make. The minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm that searches through the game tree to determine the best move for the current player.

At each level of the game tree, the algorithm alternates between maximizing the score for the computer and minimizing the score for the player. The score is determined based on the current state of the game board, with higher scores indicating a better position for the computer.

Once the algorithm has searched through the entire game tree, it returns the best move for the computer to make.

## Technologies Used
This implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
